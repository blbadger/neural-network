# neural-network

Inspired by the official Tensorflow Keras introduction (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) and load image (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images?hl=TR) tutorials. 

Contains a collection of snippets (NN_prep_snippets) to prepare test and training image datasets for a convolutional neural network (Deep_network) that is build using the Keras sequential API with a Tensorflow backend.
